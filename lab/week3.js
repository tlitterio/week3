// Usage: getRandomInt(6)
// Outputs a random number between 1 and max
function getRandomInt(max) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.floor(max)) + 1
}

// Goal: Read the "Musicessories" database into memory; write information
// about products and promotions to the JavaScript Console.
// - PART 1: Write out the number of products/promotions in the database, in a human-readable
//   format, to the JavaScript console, e.g. "There are x products."
// - PART 2: Write the name, description, and price of the first 3 products to the JavaScript
//   console – the name, description, and price should each be on its own line, and the
//   price should be formatted like "$5.49 each".
// - PART 3: Get a random promotion from the list of promotions. Display the description of the
//   promotion, along with the appropriate emoji.
//   - Discount = 🤑
//   - Shipping = 🚛
//   - Contest = 🏆

// Code that runs when the page finishes loading
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', async function() {
  // retrieves data from products API endpoint
  let response = await fetch('https://kiei451.com/api/products.json')
  let data = await response.json()

  // writes the product data to the JavaScript console
  console.log(data)

  // 🔥 YOUR CODE GOES HERE 🔥
  // Write the recipe (algorithm) in the comments. Then, write the code.

  // PART 1
  // Figure out how products there are, and store that number in memory
  productCount = data.products.length
  console.log(`Products: ${productCount}`)
  // Figure out how promotions there are, and store that number in memory
  promotiontCount = data.promotions.length
  console.log(`Promotions: ${promotiontCount}`)

  // Write the number of products to the JavaScript console

  // Write the number of promotions to the JavaScript console

  // PART 2
  // Store the first product in memory
let Product1 = data.products[0]
console.log(Product1.name)
  // Write the first product to the JavaScript console, on three separate lines
let products = data.products
  // Repeat for the 2nd and 3rd products
  // Store the second product in memory
products.forEach(element => {
  console.log(`${element.name}: ${element.description} - ${element.price}`)

});
  // Write the product to the JavaScript console, on three separate lines
  
  // Store the third product in memory

  // Write the product to the JavaScript console, on three separate lines

  // PART 3
  // Get a random integer between 1 and 10
  let promotions = data.promotions
  let randomPromo = getRandomInt(promotions.length)-1
  // Subtract one from that random integer because Arrays are zero-based
  // Use the random integer to grab a promotion from the Array of promotions
  // and store it in memory
  // Figure out which emoji should be displayed, store it in memory (you will need
  // an empty variable for this before you write any conditional)
let type = promotions[randomPromo].type
  // Create a sentence that displays the emoji along with the description 
  // of the promotion
let emoji
//   - Discount = 🤑
//   - Shipping = 🚛
//   - Contest = 🏆
if (type ==`discount`) {
  emoji = `🤑`
} else if (type == `shipping`) {
  emoji = `🚛`
} else {
  emoji = `🏆` 
}
  // Write the sentence to the JavaScript console
  console.log(`${emoji} ${promotions[randomPromo].description} - ${promotions[randomPromo].type}`)

  // 🔥 YOUR CODE ENDS HERE 🔥
